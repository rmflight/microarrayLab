# Microarray Lab

Current arrays used (including Affymetrix(r) and Agilent(r)) tend to have no 
problems with finding and calculating spot intensities. Therefore, this lab will 
concentrate on exploring data from public databases and performing a basic analysis
using open-source tools such as [`Bioconductor`](http://bioconductor.org).

## Exploration

### Data Sources

Currently DNA microarray data is deposited in 
 * [GEO](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) 
 * [ArrayExpress](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)
 
Provide a rich source of raw data for analysis.

### Bioconductor

[`Bioconductor`](http://bioconductor.org) is a set of `R` libraries specifically
developed for high-throughput biological analysis
 * Originally geared towards DNA microarray
 * Now moving more into other -omics and RNASeq
