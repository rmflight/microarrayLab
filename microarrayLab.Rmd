# Microarray Lab

Current arrays used (including Affymetrix(r) and Agilent(r)) tend to have no 
problems with finding and calculating spot intensities. Therefore, this lab will 
concentrate on exploring data from public databases and performing a basic analysis
using open-source tools such as [`Bioconductor`](http://bioconductor.org).
